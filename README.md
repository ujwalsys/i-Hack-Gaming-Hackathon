# Online Gaming Platform Framework

## Overview
This Python-based framework addresses key challenges in the Indian online gaming industry by integrating solutions for user safety, game classification, responsible gaming practices, and fraud detection. Designed for scalability and adaptability, this framework is a starting point for creating ethical, innovative, and user-friendly gaming platforms.

## Features
### 1. Addressing Consumer Issues
- **User Authentication and Data Privacy**: Secure registration and login mechanisms to ensure data protection.
- **Online Harassment Reporting**: A mechanism for users to report offensive behavior or harassment during gameplay.

### 2. Differentiating Gaming from Gambling
- **Game Classification**: Classifies games as "Skill-Based" or "Chance-Based" using keyword analysis of game descriptions.

### 3. Promoting Responsible Gaming Practices
- **Activity Tracking**: Logs users' gaming activity to monitor usage.
- **Gaming Limits Enforcement**: Temporarily disables accounts exceeding daily gaming time limits.

### 4. Fraud Detection
- **Basic Fraud Detection**: Simulates fraud detection with a random flagging mechanism (for demonstration purposes).

## Installation
1. Ensure Python 3.7 or above is installed.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/online-gaming-platform.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd online-gaming-platform
   ```
4. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
### Example Workflow
```python
from online_gaming_platform import OnlineGamingPlatform

# Initialize the platform
platform = OnlineGamingPlatform()

# Register and authenticate users
print(platform.register_user("player1", "password123"))
print(platform.authenticate_user("player1", "password123"))

# Classify games
print(platform.classify_game("Chess", "A game of strategy and decision-making."))
print(platform.classify_game("Slot Machine", "A game based on luck and chance."))

# Track activity and enforce limits
platform.track_user_activity("player1", "Chess")
print(platform.enforce_gaming_limits("player1"))

# Fraud detection
print(platform.detect_fraudulent_activity("player1"))

# Reporting harassment
print(platform.report_harassment("player1", "player2", "Used offensive language."))
```

### Outputs
- **Registration**: Confirms successful user creation.
- **Game Classification**: Identifies games as skill-based or chance-based.
- **Activity Tracking**: Monitors gaming sessions and enforces limits.
- **Fraud Detection**: Flags potential fraudulent activities.
- **Harassment Reports**: Logs and acknowledges reports.

## Future Enhancements
1. **Advanced Fraud Detection**: Use machine learning models to identify patterns of fraudulent behavior.
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: Implement real-time tracking of gaming activities.
3. **Enhanced Game Classification**: Leverage AI to better distinguish between skill and chance-based games.
4. **Multi-language Support**: Adapt the platform for multiple languages to cater to a wider audience.
